wx-model-viewer
===============

Designed to easily view weather models and switch between models, maps, and runs.

This is currently in development and as such some features may
come and go but the viewer at this address will generally be in
working order.

Models that are known to not be working right now are noted with a '*'
in front of their name.

Right now when you are on a map for a particular model and switch
to a model that does not have that map, it will go to the first
map for that model. I'm open to suggestions to how better handle
this.

HELP: Click on the question mark at the top to toggle the keyboard
mapping and other instructions.

TODO
----
I have to update this readme, fix the remaining bad models and hopefully add some more.
